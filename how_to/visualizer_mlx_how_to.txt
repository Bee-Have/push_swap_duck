FIRST

length if list will determine number of pixel per value (width)
--------
WIDTH
number of pixels = size of screen / length if list;
	-if number of pixels <= 0 : size of window * 2
	-if size of window supperior to size of screen : size = size of screen
	-re-calculate number of pixels
--------
HEIGHT
have to established biggest and smallest possible values depending on window
find biggest value in list
	biggest becomes height of biggest possible
find smallest value in list
	smallest becomes height of smallest possible
every other value will be scaled with those two
(will have to see how it looks)
(maybe establish a defined gap number)
