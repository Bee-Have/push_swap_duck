FIRST

length if list will determine number of pixel per value (width)
--------
WIDTH
number of pixels = size of screen / length if list;
	-if number of pixels <= 0 : size of window * 2
	-if size of window supperior to size of screen : size = size of screen
	-re-calculate number of pixels
--------
HEIGHT
have to established biggest and smallest possible values depending on window
find biggest value in list
	biggest becomes height of biggest possible
find smallest value in list
	smallest becomes height of smallest possible
every other value will be scaled with those two
(will have to see how it looks)
(maybe establish a defined gap number)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

recieve list
calculate width of values + window
calculate height of values
print all values (in "RED" because not stored)
read from stdin for actions

do we do the actions on tmp list ?
or just change printing values ?
wouldn't it be easier to call functions from code ? instead of reading stdin ?
ex : sa : function sends both stacks to visualiser if "VISUAL" is acivated 
visualizer just converts both stacks to printing pixels

so
how do you check value from makefile ?
instead of checking - can we set vars from makefile ?
