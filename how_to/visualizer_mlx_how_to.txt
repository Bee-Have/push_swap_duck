FIRST

length if list will determine number of pixel per value (width)
--------
WIDTH
number of pixels = size of screen / length if list;
	-if number of pixels <= 0 : size of window * 2
	-if size of window supperior to size of screen : size = size of screen
	-re-calculate number of pixels
--------
HEIGHT
have to established biggest and smallest possible values depending on window
find biggest value in list
	biggest becomes height of biggest possible
find smallest value in list
	smallest becomes height of smallest possible
every other value will be scaled with those two
(will have to see how it looks)
(maybe establish a defined gap number)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

recieve list
calculate width of values + window
calculate height of values
print all values (in "RED" because not stored)

mlx_string_put : put number of moves on screen
mlx_get_screen_size : get screen size

create your own hook for when list has changed
if it calls all hooks that were given before, it 

-------------------------------------------------------

PRINTER INIT

first setup the mlx
then start the loop_hook :
	loop_hook will repeat as long as there is no events

how no change the default stack printed by loop_hook ?
can't call visualizer again, that would restart everything.
have to call something that will change the t_list used
OR this hook function returns the new stack which will be used by the rest
but if called by another function how can it change the visu manager stack ?
OR
sperate init of mlx and updating of mlx
then call the updating one everytime you change value
sounds a little better at least
i like that solution
