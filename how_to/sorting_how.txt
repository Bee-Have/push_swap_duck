SORTING ALGORYTHMS

-----

GUIDELINES

for each element in the linked list :
search for the smallest amount of moves possible to do 
(use a threshold related to the size of the linked list)

to do so :
use linear probing to see the potential index of the node in list
compare it to the current index of the node
generate list of moves to put it at the right index
take the size of the list
that's the number of moves;

if : number is too high -> go to the next element of the list;
else : do the list of actions;

------------------------------------------------------

0_CHECK FOR SORTED VALUES

actually this method wont really work.
the bigger the list will be, the harder it will be to have already sorted values
therefore this is not good, we need something better and more general.

go through the list
for each value in node :
	- if : (value)%(size of list) = id of node
		- if node in (head) part :
			rotate until node is on top
		- else if node in (tail) :
			reverse rotate until node is on top
		- move node to list 'B'
	- else if : (value)%(size of list) != id of node
		- switch to next node
		- repeat
end

------------------------------------------------------

1_CHECKING MOVES

create int * number of moves for each node by id
create int for count in list 'A'
create int for count in list 'B'
for each node :
check if the node is in the (head) or (tail)
	- if node is in (head)
		-count number of rotate needed to be at (head)
	- if node in (tail)
		count number of reverse rotate needed to be at (head)
look for lesser value node in list 'B'
	- if node is in (head)
		count number of rotate needed to be at (head)
	- if node is in (tail)
		count number of rotate needed to be at (head)
if no lesser value node in list 'B'
find closest bigger value node in list 'B'
	- if node in (head) part
		count number of rotate needed to be at bottom
	- if node in (tail) part
		count number of reverse rotate needed to be at bottom
combine number of moves in list 'A' & number of moves in list 'B'
put number of total moves in int*
until number of total moves is under certain threshold, repeat
if no number under certain threshold, pick the smallest number

-------------------------------------------------------

2_ALGORYTHM

find an element to sort in list A
look if node is in the (head) or (tail) part of list A
	- if first part (head) :
		rotate until node is on top of list A
	- else if second part (tail)
		reverse rotate until node is on top of list A
look for lesser number in list 'B'
	if found :
		if node in (head) part :
			rotate until node is on top
		else if node in (tail) part :
			reverse rotate until node is on top
	if not found :
		check for closest bigger value node :
			if node in (head) :
				rotate until node is at bottom
			else if node in (tail) :
				reverse rotate until node is at bottom
move number to list 'B'
repeat
