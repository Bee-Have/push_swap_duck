SORTING ALGORYTHMS

-----

GUIDELINES

for each element in the linked list :
search for the smallest about of moves possible to do 
(use a threshold related to the size of the linked list)

to do so :
use linear probing to see the potential index of the value in list
compare it to the current index of the value
generate list of moves to put it at the right index
take the size of the list
that's the number of moves;

if : number is too high -> go to the next element of the list;
else : do the list of actions;
