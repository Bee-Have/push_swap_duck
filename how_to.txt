!!!!!!!!!!!!! BABY STEPS !!!!!!!!!!!!!

so

we have to sort numbers from tiniest value to bigest value

we need 2 listes chain√©es;
	- one filled with numbers
	- the other empty but with the size of the other one

start by implementing the possible operations;
we'll see where we go from there

main gets list info
	sends it to push_swap
		((in what format though ?))
		((subject explicitly says int*))
push_swap gets numbers
init struct list with numbers

//this we will do later
start sorting
